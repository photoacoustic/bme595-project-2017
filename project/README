# Title  
 Prediction of bodily metabolism using MyConnectome dataset
## Team members  
 NameA (photoacoustic), NameB (GitHubUserB)
## Goals  
 We are going to train neural network with 4D functional MRI data to predict the bodily metabolism.
## Challenges
 We are using the MyConnectome project.  
 This project had recorded brain function and metabolism fluctuate in a single individual, Dr. Poldrack over the course of an entire year.  
 That is to say the input will be 4D fMRI images, in terms of the output will be bodily metabolism(ex. this is the functional MRI image scanned after this subject drinking coffee)  
## Restrictions --optional--  
 I will be very happy if I knew a simplest way to train 4D fMRI dataset without GPU...
