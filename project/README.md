In this project, what I did are some very simple things.
1. calculate standard deviation of time series of each voxel in the brain in each scan
2. extract the location information of those voxels (x, y, z) and STD and print them in a csv files with classification of shen's 278 parcellations
3. I also measure the edge of those parcellations.
4. I might need to do more things for this final project. otherwise, I'll feel myself doing nothing.
